# Guitar Plugin Amplifier Comparison Tool
***

## What is this application?

This application is an interactive tool designed to facilitate easy engagement with recent novel analysis of guitar virtual studio technology (VST) plugin signals.

## How was the analysis conducted?

Traditional analysis of auditory signals has not typically considered time-series features. Time-series features are properties that reduce an ordered vector of data (i.e., a time series) down to a single summary statistic. Simple examples of features include the value of the [autocorrelation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation) at lag 1, the coefficient of the linear trend, and the longest period of consecutive values above the mean. [Previous work](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa) encoded >7000 time-series features into a comprehensive toolbox, while even more [recent work](https://github.com/hendersontrent/theft) brought a substantial number of these to the free and open-source setting. Time-series features have since been used to answer a 

With regards to guitar VSTs, the following procedure was implemented (a paper is in development which outlines the methodology much more rigorously):

* Set all dials to noon, disable all effects, cabinets, and microphones to isolate the head
* Pass a 20Hz-20kHz sine sweep through the amplifier to generate an emplitude waveform over time (a time series)
* Calculate time-series features for each amplifier
* Conduct statistical analysis of feature results
