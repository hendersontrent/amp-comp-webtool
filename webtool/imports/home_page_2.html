      <p>This web application is an interactive tool that presents graphical and statistical summaries of recent work that aimed to use feature-based time-series analysis to quantify the similarity of and relationships between a large sample of popular guitar VST plugins. Specifically, the analysis (and this tool) focus on guitar amplifier heads, not cabinets, combos, or anything requiring a microphone. Please note that this application is best used in a web browser on a computer - it is not optimised for mobile usage.
